# Python Utility Scripts
This repository contains a collection of general-purpose Python scripts for common maintenance tasks. All the scripts are stored in the root of the project. The /data folder is an empty folder only containing a text file that reminds you that the cleanup files you want to use for the usage of the scripts (such as a cleaning of a CSV, as an example), will have to go there.
